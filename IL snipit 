"In Major League Baseball, there are four types of injured lists. The 7-day list is specifically for players with concussions and has a minimum of 7 days off, but it can be backdated by one day. The 10-day list is for position players with any injury, requiring at least 10 days out, and can be backdated by up to 3 days. The 15-day list is for pitchers and two-way players, with similar backdating rules and a 15-day minimum. Lastly, the 60-day list is for more severe injuries, requiring at least 60 days out and temporarily removing the player from the team's 40-man roster."
