# Leveraging Machine Learning to Analyze Player Injury Return Dates and Predict Tommy John Surgery in Pitchers

## Project Overview
Machine learning(ML) is a field of artificial intelligence(AI) where computers use data and algorithms to learn patterns and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for each task. It enables systems to improve performance over time as they are exposed to more data.

This project analyzes Major League Baseball (MLB) data from 2008 to 2024, focusing on pitcher performance and injury data across the league, with an emphasis on tracking Tommy John surgeries. By exploring trends and patterns in player health and career longevity, the project aims to understand the impact of injuries, particularly Tommy John surgeries, on performance metrics over time.

Tommy John surgery is a procedure used to repair a torn ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in the elbow, a common injury for baseball pitchers due to the repetitive stress of throwing. The surgery involves replacing the damaged ligament with a tendon from elsewhere in the body. Recovery can take 12 to 18 months, but many players are able to return to their previous performance levels, although the surgery and recovery period can impact career longevity and future injury risks.

The analysis leverages historical player statistics, in-season data, and injury records to develop a machine learning model using the random forest method. This model is designed to predict future performance and injury risks for MLB players, identifying key factors that influence pitcher health and effectiveness.

The random forest technique allows for robust classification of injury risk and prediction of performance trends by capturing complex interactions between various player metrics. This data-driven approach will help teams optimize player usage, minimize injury risks, and make more informed contract and roster decisions.
 
### What is the MLB?

Major League Baseball (MLB) is the professional baseball league in North America, made up of 30 teams divided into two leagues: the American League (AL) and the National League (NL). Each team plays a long season of 162 games from April to September, followed by playoffs in October to determine the champion.

In baseball, two teams take turns playing offense and defense. The offensive team tries to score runs by hitting a ball with a bat and running to a series of four bases, while the defensive team tries to prevent this by getting the offensive players out. The game is played over nine innings, and the team with the most runs at the end wins. Pitchers, who throw the ball to the batter, play a crucial role, as do hitters, who aim to score runs.

MLB is known for its rich history, with famous teams like the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, and iconic players such as Babe Ruth and Jackie Robinson. The league is highly competitive, and its players are some of the best in the world.

## Project Steps

### 1. Objectives
The objective of this project is twofold:
    - first, to predict the number of days it takes for an MLB player to return to play after undergoing treatment or surgery, using features such as player age, recovery time, and injury type; 
    - second, to model the likelihood of Tommy John surgery occurrence/reoccurrence based on the number of pitches thrown. 

By developing machine learning models, this project aims to provide insights that can improve player recovery management and identify potential risk factors leading to Tommy John surgeries. These models will help teams make data-driven decisions regarding player health, workload, and future performance.

## Conclusion

This project leveraged advanced machine learning techniques and in-depth data analysis to explore player performance and injury risk within MLB. By combining detailed statistical datasets, we were able to make meaningful insights into injury patterns, recovery times, and potential performance after injury.

Key findings from the project include the influence of pitch count on Tommy John surgery probability and the analysis of multiple statistical injury datasets, shedding light on factors affecting recovery and return times for injured players.

The machine learning model, enhanced through optimization and fine-tuning, improved its predictive power for Tommy John surgery cases, offering insights that could be crucial for team management and player development strategies. These findings have broad implications for how data-driven decisions can shape not only individual player careers but also organizational strategies in professional sports.

Overall, this project demonstrates the power of data analytics and machine learning in the field of sports, providing actionable insights that can potentially improve both performance outcomes and long-term player health.

## Future Work

This project has established a solid foundation for analyzing MLB player performance and injury risk using machine learning and statistical techniques. However, several areas for future exploration could further enhance the project's scope and impact:

1. **Incorporate External Factors**: Future work could involve integrating external variables such as weather conditions, stadium environments, and even travel schedules to understand their impact on player performance and injury risks. These factors may provide additional predictive power for models assessing injury probabilities.

2. **Advanced Visualization Tools**: Developing a real-time dashboard or visualization tool would allow stakeholders, including coaches, team managers, and even fantasy league participants, to interact with the predictions and insights generated by the models. This would facilitate decision-making by presenting key metrics and injury risk assessments in a user-friendly format.

3. **Strategy and Financial Decisions**: Extending the project to include more advanced decision-making models that focus on team strategy, roster management, and financial implications of player injuries could add substantial value. Predictive analytics could help guide roster changes, injury management strategies, and long-term investment decisions for teams.

By addressing these areas in future work, we can further elevate the projectâ€™s analytical depth and utility, ultimately providing a more comprehensive view of player health and performance management in professional sports.


## Learning Notes

Throughout the course of this project, we encountered several key lessons that reinforced important concepts in data science and machine learning:

1. **Data Preprocessing is Critical**: We learned firsthand that a significant portion of time in any data project is spent on cleaning and preparing data. The process of combining and harmonizing multiple data sources was a major part of the work, emphasizing the importance of thorough and organized preprocessing.

2. **Proficiency in Data Scraping**: The project reinforced the importance of being proficient in data scraping and collection. Accessing reliable and well-structured data is often a challenge, and understanding how to retrieve and structure raw data is a fundamental skill for any data science project.

3. **Data Integration Across Sources**: Merging datasets from various sourcesâ€”each with their own structures and formatsâ€”was a key challenge. We learned that ensuring consistency in naming conventions, units, and data types is crucial for merging datasets without introducing errors.

4. **Iterative Model Improvement**: The machine learning aspect of this project taught us the importance of iterative model improvement. Fine-tuning models through hyperparameter optimization and feature selection proved critical for enhancing predictive performance and achieving more accurate results.

5. **Value of Cross-Disciplinary Insights**: Lastly, we recognized the value of blending domain knowledgeâ€”in this case, sports analytics and player healthâ€”with machine learning techniques. Understanding the context and implications of the data made it easier to interpret results and make actionable recommendations.
